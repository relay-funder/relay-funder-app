# CC Protocol Integration Guide

## Overview

This directory contains the complete CC Protocol integration for the Akashic crowdfunding platform. The integration implements a validated two-phase deployment workflow with comprehensive testing framework.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **Install Foundry**:

   ```bash
   curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
   source ~/.bashrc && foundryup
   ```

2. **Environment Setup**:
   ```bash
   cp env.foundry.template .env.foundry
   # Edit .env.foundry with your actual private keys and addresses
   ```

### Run Tests

```bash
# Complete workflow test
./cc-protocol-test.sh

# Specific test phases
./cc-protocol-test.sh env          # Environment validation
./cc-protocol-test.sh connect      # RPC connectivity
./cc-protocol-test.sh balance      # Admin wallet balances
./cc-protocol-test.sh workflow     # Deployment workflow

# Payment validation tests
./cc-protocol-test.sh pledge-test  # KeepWhatsRaised pledge patterns
./cc-protocol-test.sh payment-test # PaymentTreasury credit card flow
./cc-protocol-test.sh payment-flows# All payment tests
./cc-protocol-test.sh full         # Complete suite + payments
```

## Architecture

### Two-Phase Deployment Workflow

The CC Protocol requires a specific deployment pattern:

1. **Campaign Creation** → Deploy `CampaignInfo` contract
2. **Admin Approval** → Deploy dual treasuries using `CampaignInfo` address

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Creates Campaign] --> B[Deploy CampaignInfo Contract]
    B --> C[Store CampaignInfo Address]
    C --> D[Admin Reviews Campaign]
    D --> E[Admin Approves Campaign]
    E --> F[Deploy KeepWhatsRaised Treasury]
    E --> G[Deploy PaymentTreasury]
    F --> H[Campaign Active with Dual Treasuries]
    G --> H
```

### Treasury Types

| Contract            | Purpose                             | Implementation ID |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **KeepWhatsRaised** | Crypto-only payments (USDC)         | `0`               |
| **PaymentTreasury** | Credit card payments via Crowdsplit | `1`               |

## Application Integration

### Critical Fixes Applied

1. **Admin Approval Hook Fixed** (`lib/web3/hooks/useAdminApproveCampaign.ts`):

   ```typescript
   // BEFORE: Wrong parameter order and single treasury
   const tx = await treasuryFactory.deploy(
     platformConfig.platformBytes,
     0, // Wrong position
     campaignAddress,
     { gasLimit: 100000 },
   );

   // AFTER: Correct dual treasury deployment
   const cryptoTx = await treasuryFactory.deploy(
     platformConfig.platformBytes, // platformHash
     campaignAddress, // infoAddress (CampaignInfo contract)
     0, // implementationId (KeepWhatsRaised)
     `Campaign ${campaignId} Crypto`,
     `C${campaignId}CRYPTO`,
     { gasLimit: 2000000 },
   );
   ```

2. **API Routes Updated** (`app/api/campaigns/[campaignId]/approve/route.ts`):

   ```typescript
   // BEFORE: Single treasury address
   const { treasuryAddress } = await req.json();

   // AFTER: Dual treasury support
   const {
     treasuryAddress, // Legacy support
     cryptoTreasuryAddress,
     paymentTreasuryAddress,
     cryptoTreasuryTx,
     paymentTreasuryTx,
   } = body;
   ```

3. **Treasury Managers Enhanced**:

   - `lib/treasury/managers/CryptoTreasuryManager.ts`: Fixed CampaignInfo validation
   - `lib/treasury/managers/PaymentTreasuryManager.ts`: Corrected deployment parameters

4. **Database Schema Enhanced**:
   - Added `CRYPTO_ONLY`, `PAYMENT_ONLY`, `LEGACY` treasury modes
   - Migration ready: `20250721162000_add_treasury_mode_options`

### Web3 Integration Patterns

#### Two-Phase Deployment Implementation

```typescript
// Phase 1: Campaign Creation (Deploy CampaignInfo)
const campaignInfoFactory = new ethers.Contract(
  CAMPAIGN_INFO_FACTORY_ADDRESS,
  CampaignInfoFactoryABI,
  signer,
);

const tx = await campaignInfoFactory.createCampaign(
  creator,
  identifierHash,
  [PLATFORM_HASH],
  [],
  [],
  { launchTime, deadline, goalAmount },
);

// Phase 2: Admin Approval (Deploy Dual Treasuries)
const treasuryFactory = new ethers.Contract(
  TREASURY_FACTORY_ADDRESS,
  TreasuryFactoryABI,
  signer,
);

// Deploy KeepWhatsRaised Treasury
const cryptoTx = await treasuryFactory.deploy(
  platformHash,
  campaignInfoAddress, // CRITICAL: Must be CampaignInfo contract
  0, // implementationId (KeepWhatsRaised)
  `Campaign ${campaignId} Crypto`,
  `C${campaignId}CRYPTO`,
);

// Deploy PaymentTreasury
const paymentTx = await treasuryFactory.deploy(
  platformHash,
  campaignInfoAddress, // CRITICAL: Must be CampaignInfo contract
  1, // implementationId (PaymentTreasury)
  `Campaign ${campaignId} Payment`,
  `C${campaignId}PAY`,
);
```

#### Payment Processing

**Crypto Payments (KeepWhatsRaised)**:

```typescript
const cryptoTreasury = new ethers.Contract(
  campaign.cryptoTreasuryAddress,
  KeepWhatsRaisedABI,
  signer,
);

const tx = await cryptoTreasury.pledgeWithoutAReward(
  backerAddress,
  pledgeAmount, // in USDC wei (6 decimals)
  tipAmount,
);
```

**Credit Card Payments (PaymentTreasury)**:

```typescript
const paymentTreasury = new ethers.Contract(
  campaign.paymentTreasuryAddress,
  PaymentTreasuryABI,
  signer,
);

// Step 1: Create payment
const createTx = await paymentTreasury.createPayment(
  paymentId,
  buyerAddress,
  itemId,
  amount,
  expiration,
);

// Step 2: Confirm payment (webhook)
const confirmTx = await paymentTreasury.confirmPayment(paymentId);
```

## Testing Framework

### Environment Variables

Required in `.env.foundry`:

```bash
# RPC Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL=https://alfajores-forno.celo-testnet.org

# Contract Addresses (Celo Alfajores)
NEXT_PUBLIC_TREASURY_FACTORY=0x...
NEXT_PUBLIC_GLOBAL_PARAMS=0x...
NEXT_PUBLIC_CAMPAIGN_INFO_FACTORY=0x...
NEXT_PUBLIC_USDC_ADDRESS=0x...

# Platform Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_PLATFORM_HASH=0x...
NEXT_PUBLIC_PLATFORM_ADMIN=0x...
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROTOCOL_ADMIN=0x...

### Common Errors & Solutions

| Error                                           | Cause                                         | Solution                                                   |
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `TreasuryFactoryImplementationNotSetOrApproved` | Implementation not approved by protocol admin | Run protocol admin approval transaction                    |
| `CampaignInfoInvalidInput`                      | Invalid CampaignInfo contract address         | Ensure `campaignAddress` is deployed CampaignInfo contract |
| `unexpected argument` in cast commands          | Wrong command syntax                          | Check parameter order and format                           |

### Troubleshooting

#### Treasury Deployment Fails

- ✅ Verify CampaignInfo address is valid contract
- ✅ Check platform admin has sufficient CELO
- ✅ Ensure implementations are approved

#### Payment Processing Fails

- ✅ Verify correct treasury address for payment type
- ✅ Check treasury mode configuration
- ✅ Confirm payment expiration times

#### Address Format Errors

- ✅ Clean padded addresses from contract calls
- ✅ Validate 20-byte address format
- ✅ Handle hex/decimal conversions properly

#### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check campaign info
cast call $CAMPAIGN_INFO_ADDRESS "getDeadline()" --rpc-url $RPC_URL

# Check treasury balance
cast call $TREASURY_ADDRESS "getRaisedAmount()" --rpc-url $RPC_URL

# Check admin balance
cast balance $ADMIN_ADDRESS --rpc-url $RPC_URL
```

## Next Steps

### Payment Validation (Ready to Execute)

1. **Treasury Address Extraction**: Parse actual addresses from deployment transaction logs
2. **Live Payment Testing**: Execute real `pledgeWithoutAReward()` and payment confirmation flows
3. **Balance Validation**: Test treasury balance queries with deployed contracts
4. **Application Integration**: Validate payment routing to correct deployed treasury addresses

### Database Integration

Update campaigns with dual treasury addresses:

```typescript
await db.campaign.update({
  where: { id: campaignId },
  data: {
    status: CampaignStatus.ACTIVE,
    cryptoTreasuryAddress,
    paymentTreasuryAddress,
    treasuryAddress: cryptoTreasuryAddress, // Primary for backward compatibility
    treasuryMode: 'DUAL',
  },
});
```

- **Payment Patterns**: Documented and validated with real contracts
- **Database Schema**: Updated for dual treasury support

### 📋 **Function Patterns Confirmed**

#### KeepWhatsRaised (Crypto-Only Flow)

```bash
# Pledge without reward
pledgeWithoutAReward(address backer, uint256 pledgeAmount, uint256 tip)

# Read functions
getRaisedAmount() → uint256
getAvailableRaisedAmount() → uint256
getDeadline() → uint256
getGoalAmount() → uint256
getWithdrawalApprovalStatus() → bool
```

#### PaymentTreasury (Credit Card Flow)

```bash
# Payment workflow
createPayment(bytes32 paymentId, address buyer, bytes32 itemId, uint256 amount, uint256 expiration)
confirmPayment(bytes32 paymentId)

# Read functions
getRaisedAmount() → uint256
getAvailableRaisedAmount() → uint256

# Admin functions
disburseFees()
withdraw()
claimRefund(bytes32 paymentId, address refundAddress)
```

### 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Get PaymentTreasury implementation approved** by protocol admin
2. **Fund test wallets** with USDC for actual payment testing
3. **Configure deployed treasuries** with campaign deadlines and goals
4. **Test complete payment flows** with real transactions
5. **Validate treasury balance updates** after payments
